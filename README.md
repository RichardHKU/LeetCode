# LeetCode Practice Journey 🚀

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repo documents my journey through coding challenges, algorithm practice, and problem-solving skills development using Python.

## 📋 About This Repository

I use GitHub Issues to track my LeetCode practice sessions, thoughts, and learning progress. Each issue represents either:
- A specific LeetCode problem solution
- Weekly/monthly practice summaries
- Algorithm concept explanations
- Debugging sessions and lessons learned

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Master common algorithms and data structures
- Build consistency in daily practice
- Document learning process and insights
- Prepare for technical interviews

## 📊 Progress Tracking

You can find my practice sessions and thoughts in the [Issues](../../issues) section. Issues are labeled by:
- **Problem Type**: Array, String, Tree, Graph, etc.
- **Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Status**: Solved, In Progress, Review Needed
- **Concepts**: Specific algorithms or patterns used

## 🏷️ Issue Labels

- `easy` `medium` `hard` - Problem difficulty
- `array` `string` `tree` `graph` `dp` - Data structures/algorithms
- `solved` `in-progress` `review` - Solution status
- `insight` - Key learning moments
- `practice-session` - Daily/weekly summaries

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- **Primary Language**: Python 3.x
- **IDE**: [Your preferred IDE]
- **Testing**: Built-in Python testing when needed
